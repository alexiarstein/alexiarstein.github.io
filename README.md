### Personal Docs Project.

It's not really a wiki since I am probably going to be the sole contributor to this project.

It's merely a way to share technical documentation with the whole wide world rapidly.

Articles might be written in English or Spanish depending on my mood. Ideally in both languages. 

It's more of a hobby than anything else.
